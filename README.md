What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
Since my website uses a lot of common elements in many pages (like the left nav bar), I would design it to release version before applying it to all other pages because then, if I needed to change something on main page I needed to copy this change to all other pages.

What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?
I would finish the caption on the carousel (right now, captions are not aligned with the posters).
I would work more with the light theme because the light theme right now is all over the place.
I would definitely fix the table on the favorites page. It should reduce the number of columns when the screen becomes narrower. Also, the font size should dynamically adjust to the screen size.
This is NOT a good look for a site

Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.
Design and containerize ALL the pages before coding.
Use different CSS files for different HTML files.
